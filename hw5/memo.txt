explore.c:
The local automatic variable d is stored in a stack and so it has a
different memory address compared to a,b and c which are external and
static variables as static and external variables are stored in BSS.
In the run, we can see local variable's address beginning with ff 
while all other variables have address beginning with 80. 

Similarly, when priniting the address of array from 0 to 6, we see the
value of external and static variables being printed again. Also, when 
we check the memory location, it is quite visible that since array is made
of int, each index increaes by 4 bytes.

Now, when we enter foobar.c, at many points we can see the same value being 
repeated. We also see the value of d and a being printed as well.
But it also prints the value of ap and dp as well. This is because of the way
foobar has been called by passing these values as paraeters.


At the end it is quite clear that main() is passed into the stack followed by
the foobar() making it possible for us to access the local variables.
