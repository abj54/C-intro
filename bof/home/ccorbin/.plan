I grew up in Ohio, north of Cincinnati, which was relatively flat.
I moved to Tampa, FL from there, which was also relatively flat.
Since I moved up here, I have enjoyed hiking mountains in NH.
I am hoping to take an ice climbing class this winter, with hopes of
climbing Mt. Washington in the winter.
